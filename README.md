# Password Holder
Password Holder is a simple Python application that allows you to manage and store your passwords securely using Fernet encryption.

## Features
- Create a new encryption key.
- Load an existing encryption key.
- Create a new password file and initialize it with initial values.
- Load an existing password file and decrypt the stored passwords.
- Add a new password entry to the file.
- Retrieve a stored password.

## How It Works
This project uses the `cryptography` library's Fernet encryption to securely store and manage passwords. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Encryption Key:** You can create a new encryption key or load an existing one. The key is necessary to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
2. **Password File:** You can create a new password file or load an existing one. Passwords are stored in this file, and they are encrypted using the provided encryption key.
3. **Adding Passwords:** You can add new passwords to the file, and they will be encrypted using the encryption key.
4. **Retrieving Passwords:** You can retrieve stored passwords by providing the site for which you want to access the password. The password is decrypted and displayed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinghJayant777/Password-Holder.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**
bash
Copy code
cd Password-Holder


**Run the PasswordManager:**
bash
Copy code
python password_manager.py

The program will guide you through options for creating an encryption key, managing password files, and storing/retrieving passwords.
